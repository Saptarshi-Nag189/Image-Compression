# Image-Compression
Image size compression using k-means clustering. This python program takes an image (.jpg or .png) as input. Then it uses the k-means clustering method to cluster similar colours into the same colour. It reduces the size of the image without drastically reducing the quality of the image. The amount of compression can be selected by the user.
